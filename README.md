# Manchester Echoes Visitor Sentiment Study at Heaton Park

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analysing volunteer feedback and engagement patterns for an event, with a strong emphasis on **sentiment analysis**, **data quality**, and **behavioural insights**.  
The goal is to demonstrate an end-to-end data analytics and NLP workflow — from raw data cleaning to actionable insight generation.

## ⚠️ Important Note on Dataset
**Note**:  
This dataset has been intentionally modified for **research and learning purposes**. Several variables were programmatically manipulated to introduce **controlled ambiguity** and **realistic behavioural patterns**.  

The dataset should therefore be used **only for analytical demonstration, modelling, and exploratory research**, and must **not** be interpreted as a direct representation of real-world survey outcomes.

## 🔍 Key Objectives & Scope
The project covers the following analytical stages:

- Data cleaning and data wrangling  
- Handling missing, ambiguous, and inconsistent values  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Analysis of demographic and attendance patterns  
- Data preparation for sentiment analysis  
- Text normalization and feedback consolidation  
- Sentiment analysis using NLP techniques  
  - VADER (rule-based sentiment analysis)  
  - DistilBERT (transformer-based deep learning model)  
- Insight extraction from sentiment results  
- Visualisation of key findings  
- Word cloud generation to highlight dominant feedback themes

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy** – data manipulation
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – visualisation
- **NLTK (VADER)** – sentiment scoring
- **Transformers (DistilBERT)** – advanced NLP
- **Scikit-learn** – preprocessing & evaluation
- **Jupyter Notebook** – analysis and experimentation

## 📊 Key Insights
- Pre-event guidance methods significantly influence volunteer retention.
- Structured guidance (app instructions, staff guidance) is associated with more positive sentiment.
- Text-based feedback reveals recurring themes around organisation, communication, and overall experience.
